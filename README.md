This code was developed using PyTorch in the PyCharm environment for encrypted federated learning. It functions as expected without requiring any further modifications. For the FedProx algorithm, optimal performance is achieved with a Fedprox_mu value of 0.9 and a learning rate of 0.005. In the case of the SAC algorithm, a learning rate of 1e-5 yields good results. For binary classification with entropy loss, a learning rate of 1e-5 also performs well. Additionally, for the encryption component, improved loss performance is observed when using a random seed of 42.
